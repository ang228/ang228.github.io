<h3>About me:</h4>
<p>
    I am an undergraduate student at Tufts University majoring in math and biochemistry. As a student researcher in the Wattrus Lab at MGH, I study the role of the immune system in regulating spinal cord regeneration in zebrafish. My research interests include developmental and regenerative biology, as well as the application of math to biological systems.
